  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    My name is Daniel Tello-Torres, I am a Latino student aspiring to be a web designer along with creating my own website. Although I was originally born in Mexico, growing up I did not have a sense of community. I lived in completely different places in North and South America, so I would always move. I dealt with many hardships throughout life because I lived in unsafe environments. My goal is to help and build communities along with using my skills that establish equity, diversity, and inclusivity.  
  </p>
<br>
<br>
  <p>
    Throughout my path in education I gained interest in design, primarily in the digital field. Learning how to use certain tools has helped me to broaden my skills and think of how I can apply them to specific jobs in my career. Because of that, I want to help others by creating something that is appealing and useful for them. Through the process of design, I want to also identify problems to solve to provide a friendly and inclusive user experience for all. I believe that connecting with people and understanding their perspective helps build pillars to a more diverse environment. 
  </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    To reach my goal, I will continue to pursue my interests and use them throughout my career. I hope to create something impactful that can be used to help people and provide excellent services.
